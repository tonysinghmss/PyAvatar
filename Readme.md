According to hindu belief, God descends on earth to save the righteous people from the wrath of wrong doers.

The servers provided by Indian IT industries for development phase don't have internet connection. The developer has to mannually download all the dependencies and put it on the server for testing and deployment. This unavailability of internet renders the pip tool useless in case you are doing python development using such a server.

This script will download all the dependencies written in a given text file, preferrably a requirements.txt file, into a given local folder path from pypi server. You can then directly take this folder and transfer it to your development server in one go, saving you a good amount of time.
